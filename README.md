# Bike

Mainly for road quality assessment from cycling around

I'll put a parts list and an installer together but until I have the hardware all together and tested out this is all up in the air and probably doesn't work

Also I'm going to rename this at some point for obvious reasons

Features:
- Cuts off the first and last 5 minutes (configurable) from your ride so nobody knows where you're coming and going to by sharing your ride info
	- Additionally it cuts first x metres and last x metres. Whichever happens last, time or distance for the start or end takes effect
- Doesn't store the actual time of day, only relative time from the start of the turning on of the device

Future:
- CI
- Build an image so can handily install
- Configure wifi so files uploaded when home without having to do anything
- Some sort of backend
- Visualization / Stats over multiple journeys
